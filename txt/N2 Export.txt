Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for <b>thick</b> depicts a <i>child</i> abandoned out on the wild <i>cliffs</i>, exposed to the heat of the <i>sun</i>, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as <b>thick</b> as the parent who left it there.

There were 3 little islands in the stream who all decided to set themselves up as independent states.	"シュウ　The original meaning of this character was ""sandbar"", and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American states.

The extra <i>drop</i> to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a <i>walking stick</i> dropped into <i>water</i> to form an <b>icicle</b>. If it helps, when you hold an <b>icicle</b> up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji.

The final 4 strokes (the element for <i>water</i>) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for <i>little</i>.	White is a symbol of purety, so white water is pure water, the precise definition of spring water.	Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring.

163	152	163	pressure	圧	"<img src=""E59CA7.png"" />"		pressure, cliff, soil, dirt, ground	5	8		One of the things that causes the erosion of <i>soil</i> is the excessive <b>pressure</b> of the top<i>soil</i> on the lower <i>soil</i>. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep <i>cliff</i> without a tree in sight. The <b>slightest</b> pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character.		The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous pressure.	For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.	5	2	アツ、エン、オウ	お.す、へ.す、おさ.える、お.さえる	圧迫(あっぱく): pressure, coercion, oppression<br>圧力(あつりょく): stress, pressure<br>抑圧(よくあつ): check, restraint, oppression, suppression<br>圧縮(あっしゅく): compression, condensation, pressure<br>気圧(きあつ): atmospheric pressure<br>血圧(けつあつ): blood pressure		JLPT_2 Jouyou_5

Instead of using the traditional wax <b>seal</b>, you <i>glue</i> a sprig of <i>ivy</i> on the outside. In this way the elements <i>ivy</i> and <i>glue</i> give you a curious and memorable way to <b>seal</b> your secret letters.		The king used a special seal of ivy leaves glued onto his document.	A bit of ivy glued to a letter can make a lovely SEAL when in a pinch, says Martha Stewart.

It pictures <i>soil</i> being scooped up into a <i>ladle</i> and then made <b>level</b> (apparently because one is measuring <i>soil</i>). The excess <i>drops of soil</i> are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added <i>drop</i> at the <i>ladle's</i> edge.		Soil is scooped up into a ladel.

180	168	180	ashes	灰	"<img src=""E781B0.png"" />"		ashes, cliff, fire	6	8		The kanji for <b>ashes</b> naturally includes the primitive for <i>fire</i>, or more specifically, a <i>fireplace</i>. Now what do you do with that bucket of <b>ashes</b> you have just cleaned out of the <i>fireplace</i>? You walk to the edge of a <i>cliff</i> and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the <i>fire</i>, once it has turned to <b>ashes</b>, ends up at the bottom of the <i>cliff</i>.		The fire underneath the cliff will eventually turn everything above to ashes.

If you glaze a pot and put it into the <i>oven</i> to <i>fire</i> it, you in fact <i>illuminate</i> it. Hence the kanji for <b>illuminate</b> compares the kanji for <i>shining</i> with the primitive element for the <i>oven's fire</i>.		SHINING FLAMES illuminate!

Be sure to get a clear image of the <i>water</i>&nbsp;when you put it all together.		You need WATER and FISH for fishing.	If you are confusing this with angling like me, take fishing to mean not the act of catching a fish but the act of being a fish not living but fishing (i.e. in the water).	4	2	ギョ、リョウ	あさ.る	漁船(ぎょせん): fishing boat<br>漁村(ぎょそん): fishing village<br>漁業(ぎょぎょう): fishing (industry)<br>漁師(りょうし): fisherman	漁業 (ぎょぎょう), 漁船 (ぎょせん), 漁村 (ぎょそん)	JLPT_2 Jouyou_4

I did such a quantity of work that when NIGHT BREAK came, I was asleep on the COMPUTER.	If you find that by nightbreak, you´re still playing at your computer, chances are your World of Warcraft character has a high quantity of levels. [thanks to ssmoler] .....

The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but <i>shells</i>, a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The <i>nail</i> under the roof of the <i>house</i> points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's <i>shells</i> for safekeeping.		It takes a lot more than one clam of savings to buy a house on a street.	My SAVINGS plan - I nail my moneybags up in the rafters below my roof.

The more proper way to <b>plant</b> a young <i>tree</i> and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up <i>straight</i>.

Usually this is due to simple <i>old age</i>, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled <i>old tree</i>, <b>withering</b> away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over.		A tree withers away as it gets old.

If you´ve ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you´ll remember that every town was all bordered off by a line of trees with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were glued together so you could only exit town through the main or side gates, (so you couldn´t escape the important scripted scenes.).	Pfft.

There are so many abbreviations and acronyms nowadays that no brain can remember each of them. Mnemonic: ab-brain-each-ation.

If my LIDDED CROCK has the same CIRCUMFERENCE as my head, I like to use it as a HELMET.	You´re at a motorcycle store looking to buy a helmet.

The kanji does this with a <i>taskmaster</i> whipping a <i>tree</i> into producing <b>sheets</b> against its will.		The taskmaster is a strict bathroom monitor who hands out only one sheet of really rough, splintery toilet paper per person. You can see the wood fibers.	This taskmaster is the bathroom nazi: he counts how many sheets of toilet paper and tissue you use, and then tells you what % of a tree you just killed.	6	2	マイ、バイ		枚(まい): counter for flat objects (e.g. sheets of paper)<br>枚数(まいすう): the number of flat things		JLPT_2 Jouyou_6

A successful marathon runner needs to be able to transcend seductions, such as the possibility of rest, shelter from the rain, or a cold beer.

All one needs to add is some image of <b>sweet</b> cakes or breads carried in the basket, and the union of picture and meaning is complete. Take care not to confuse with <i>confectionary</i> (Frame 1203).	* As a primitive, the pictograph's meaning of a <i>wicker basket</i> is used, a small one like the kind used for picnics.	Little red riding hood is carrying around a wicker basket filled with sweet baked cookies for granny.	Girls are kinda sweet and sexy until they reach their twenties. So 20 minus ONE.

"Like the ""ero inquiry"" that had been partially swept under the rug (see inquire (#1145)), this kanji depicts the investigation into the forestry scandal being shelved."

The king is peacefully sleeping on his new tatami mat when all of a sudden a shelf falls over and kills him.

Making tatami mats from rice field waste was Japan´s crowning achievement, but for some reason other countries just shelved the idea.

1924	1785	1924	row	並	"<img src=""E4B8A6.png"" />"		row	8	47		This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for <i>stand up</i>. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.	* The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it. ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line. We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to <i>upside down in a row</i>.	This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of two people standing in a row.	"Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a rowing boat. In a rowing boat people sit in rows, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for ""rowboat"" coming at frame 1876. The rowing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for ""rowboat"" has a generic meaning of ""a small boat"".

A row of suns is actually a normal, plain, and ordinary occurrence in an infinitely large and expanding universe. FUtsuu.	To me, row is way too close to file (#812), so I´m adopting Fab´s meaning of rowboat from the previous frame. Universal Studios went through a number of logo animations before settling on the one they are most famous for: the letters UNIVERSAL orbiting the Earth.

2012	1868	2012	boat	舟	"<img src=""E8889F.png"" />"		boat	6	50		After the <i>drop</i> and the <i>glass canopy</i>, we come to a combination of three strokes that we met only once before, in the character for <i>mama</i> (frame 105). The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps.		I see this kanji as a pictograph of a two story boat seen from the front. The glass canopy is the body of the boat. The drop on top is the chimney. The horizontal line is the ceiling/floor between the the 1st/2nd floor. Finally, the two drops in the middle are the lights on the decks.	Cinnabar (丹) colored boat, the extra drop signifying that the paint hasn´t dried yet. The stick represents the oars.

Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a <i>crown</i> tied about one <i>leg</i> before the unfortunate party is tossed into the <i>water</i>.		(thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she sinks. She shouldn´t have been so nosy about her yakuza-boyfriend´s schemes.	"This is the famous story of Archimedes and the Crown, where buoyancy was discovered.

Think of the seats having been taken out so that they can be reupholstered with this decorated <b>leather</b>.		I asked the street vendor the price of the LEATHER jacket.

The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for <i>complete</i>, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of <i>water</i>.		Think of a picture of someone steaming vegetables. On top you see the flowers of cauliflower or something else that is being steamed. Underneath, the pan is completely full of water. Below the pan is a floor - that's the hotplate - and under that the oven fire. Caution: don't confuse with boil (#1257), or the steam radical in spirit (#1885).	When you want to steam some flowers/vegetation you don't cover them completely with water, rather you have just a little at the floor of the saucepan and then heat.	6	2	ジョウ、セイ	む.す、む.れる、む.らす	蒸留(じょうりゅう): distillation<br>蒸気(じょうき): steam, vapour<br>蒸発(じょうはつ): evaporation, unexplained disappearance<br>水蒸気(すいじょうき): water vapour, steam<br>蒸し暑い(むしあつい): humid, sultry<br>蒸す(むす): to steam, poultice, be sultry	蒸す (む.す), 蒸らす (む.らす), 蒸れる (む.れる)	JLPT_2 Jouyou_6

The form is based on the middle portion of the preceding character, with three additional strokes, best thought of as the kanji for <i>three</i>.		To get someone to completely acquiesce it takes 3 dunks in the water before they give.	To get someone to acquiesce, duck them completely in aqua (=water) three times.

The elements are: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>snare</i> . . . <i>mouth</i> . . . <i>crotch</i> . . . <i>floor</i>.		Can simplify this using decay (#1243). Then: The expedition to the poles is bad for your health, and the decay that started in your mouth spreads to your crotch – at which point you fall to the floor.	(modified Katsuo) Can simplify this using decay (#1243). You travel to the poles, a frozen wasteland. In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is decayed (see story for decay (#1243)) so you catch no prey.

If you reverse your <i>hand</i> and put its palm down, you will have the side on which <b>fur</b> grows.		I´ve heard of people having hair on the back of their hands, but this is ridiculous!

There´s a road that´s been inverted- it´s gone from horizontal to directly vertical! The only beast that could possibly climb it is a mountain goat of course.	This reminds me of a cartoon I saw once, perhaps it was with Donald Duck. he is startled and furious when he chases this mountain billygoat further and further up the mountain road, untill the angle is so steep that he finds himself inverted.
