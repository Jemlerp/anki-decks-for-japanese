(Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read ""four <b>ten-thousands</b>"" by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to <i>bind up</i> a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for <i>one</i> and <i>bound up</i> naturally come to form <b>ten thousand</b>. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for <i>bound up</i> in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together."		I bound ten thousand dollars together and hid it under the floor.

The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck.	* As a primitive, the meaning of <i>child</i> is retained, though you might imagine a little older <i>child</i>, able to run around and get into more mischief.	A child who is ten will still ask for his ma (top looks a bit like katakana ma).	A pictograph of a child, with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?).

A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; being able to write it beautifully is another thing.	* The primitive meaning is the same: <i>woman</i>.	"To remember the order of strokes, remember a female ninja is called a ""kunoichi"". That is, く(hiragana) ノ(katakana) 一(kanji, ichi=one)."

105	101	105	mama	母	"<img src=""E6AF8D.png"" />"		mama, mother, breasts	5	6		Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for <i>woman</i> in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a <b>mama</b>. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.	* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of <i>breasts</i> in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.	The two breasts of a momma who breastfeeds.	This mama had twins, one mouth for each nipple.	2	5	ボ	はは、も	お祖母さん(おばあさん): grandmother, female senior-citizen<br>伯母さん(おばさん): aunt<br>父母(ちちはは): father and mother, parents<br>分母(ぶんぼ): denominator<br>母校(ぼこう): alma mater<br>保母(ほぼ): day care worker in a kindergarten nursery school etc.<br>母親(ははおや): mother<br>父母(ふぼ): father and mother, parents<br>祖母(そぼ): grand mother<br>お母さん(おかあさん): (polite) mother	母 (はは)	JLPT_5 Jouyou_2

That meaning comes in the next frame. Here <b>little</b> means ""small"" or ""tiny."" The image is one of three <b>little</b> <i>drops</i>, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: <b>little</b>, <b>little</b>, nothing but <b>little</b>."	* The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards.	A little penguin with its wings at its side.

It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms.	* As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a <i>large dog</i> or, if you prefer, a <i>St. Bernard dog</i>. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made.	A person stretching their arms and legs to look large and scare a bear away.

All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a <b>stream</b>.	* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of <i>stream</i> the more vivid image of a <i>flood</i>. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements:<div>on the left, it is written the same.</div><div>on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs</div><div>on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook</div>	So as not to confuse this with river (#146) think of streamers falling down.

Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a <i>walking stick</i> being dropped vertically into the <b>water</b>, sending <i>droplets</i> out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.	* As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive. This latter, as we will see, is far more common.	The kanji for water is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig´s story doesn´t do this).

All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try.	* As a primitive, the sense of <i>soil</i> is extended to that of <i>ground</i> because of its connection with the kanji for the same (Frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of <i>dirt</i> and <i>land</i>.	Remembering soil is easy. If soil is soft, you can take a walking stick and plunge it two* feet into the ground.

""Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you."" Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. <b>Time</b> is a <i>sun</i> rising over a <i>Buddhist temple</i>. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character."		When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it´s time to get up.	In ancient Japan, TIME of ´´day´´ was announced at the ´´buddhist temples´´. They did this by ringing large iron bells.

It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.	* To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a <i>fireplace</i> (or <i>hearth</i>) or a raging <i>conflagration</i> like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for <i>fire</i>, based on this one, is written as 4 small drops and will mean <i>flames</i>, <i>cauldron</i>, <i>cooking fire</i>, or an <i>oven fire</i>.	For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on fire!

When the middle is opened up to make room for other elements, it means a <i>boulevard</i>.	I use The Flash for for this primitive; a superhero who is always going very fast.	To me, this looks like a bridge going over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it. Being that I live near the ocean, I see tourists and vacationers coming and going constantly on the bridge. Because the bridge is so long, it forms an arc to support the structural integrity.

The abstract notion of <i>person</i> so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use <i>person</i> for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular <i>person</i>.

He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”."

So it is convenient to find the character for <i>four</i> in this kanji. But since we want only <i>one</i> of the <i>four</i> directions, the <b>west</b> adds the <i>one</i> at the top and sucks the <i>human legs</i> a bit out of their <i>mouth</i> in the process.	* As a primitive, the meaning of <i>west</i> can be expanded to refer to the <i>Old West</i> of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for <i>east</i> was expanded into <i>the East</i>. Note, however, that in its primitive form the <i>legs</i> are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the <i>mouth</i>. Hence, we get the shape ⻃. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives.	The old west represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare sign of the bird (#1427) whiskey bottle about one third full).
