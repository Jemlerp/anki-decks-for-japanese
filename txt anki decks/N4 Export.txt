Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4.	* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of <i>rice field</i> is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of <i>brains</i> from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls.	A rice field divided into four parts.	Ten people use their mouths to eat the yield of the rice fields.	1	4	デン	た	水田(すいでん): (water-filled) paddy field<br>田園(でんえん): country, rural districts<br>田(た): rice field<br>田植え(たうえ): rice planting<br>田ぼ(たんぼ): paddy field, farm<br>田舎(いなか): the country, country side	田 (た)	JLPT_4 Jouyou_1

This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine <i>sun</i>flowers with <i>needles</i> for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of <b>early</b> is easily remembered if one thinks of the <i>sun</i>flower as the <b>early</b> riser in the garden, because the <i>sun</i>, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10).	* As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of <i>sunflower</i>, which was used to make the abstract key word <i>early</i> more graphic.	The sun up is early, well before ten.

Look at that <i>mouth</i> bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for <i>tied up</i> is written - just as it had been with the character for <i>ten thousand</i>.		I don´t know about you but to me this seems like someone´s head is about to be separated from his body. You can see he´s kneeling and his mouth is wide open gasping for the last breath he will ever take.	A wise old samurai keeps his hostages (with their mouths bound up to keep them quiet) in a separate room from his sabers.

Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a <b>fish</b> is caught and <i>bound up</i> on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the <i>rice fields</i> for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a <i>cooking fire</i> for his supper.		The elements of this kanji are bound up, rice field and cooking fire. When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind fish.

Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a <b>special</b> class all its own - like the sacred <i>cows</i> of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the <i>cows</i> should be placed on the sacred grounds of a <i>Buddhist temple</i> in this kanji.		Think of not special people, but special animals. The sacred Hindu cows are special - they can wander around the temple without fear of becoming roast beef.

As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to ""read off"" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the <i>drop</i> down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel."	* As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass <i>candlestick</i> (with the drop representing the flame at the top).	A lord is a little drop down from King in hierarchy.	Although this kanji´s meaning hasn´t caused me much trouble, I´ve had problems remembering the direction of the drop above king, since drops at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions. To remember this one, I think of the placement of the drop in jewel (#256).
