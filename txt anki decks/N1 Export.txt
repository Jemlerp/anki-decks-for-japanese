Probably you were foolish enough to <b>risk</b> a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a <i>sun</i> above and an <i>eye</i> right below looking up at it has the meaning of <b>risk</b> (see frame 12).		Don´t look at the sun directly with your eyes, it´s risky!	You´ll risk your eyesight if you look up at the sun.

So think of the key word, <b>chant</b>, as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 11).		Someone chanting with their mouth open for two consecutive days.

And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature <i>sun</i>. This kanji is a picture of a tiny <i>sun</i> in three places (that is, ""everywhere""), to give the sense of something that <b>sparkles</b> on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole."

Spine connects head and body.	The spine goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (genitals).

In this kanji we see <i>two suns</i>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the <i>three suns</i> of <i>sparkle</i>.

Remember the Vulcan salute from ´Star Trek´ (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase ´live long and PROSPER´?

What all of this has to do with the <b>gall bladder</b> is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the <b>gall bladder</b> is supposed to filter out), and change it to ""not letting the <i>night break</i> on your anger"" (or your <b>gall</b>) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then ""sleeping it off."""

Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a <i>thousand</i> sharp <i>needles</i>, and the quaint little <b>measuring box</b> becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of <i>thousand</i>. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last.		It is a thousand or ten? I need my measuring box.	I can fit a thousand needles into my measuring box, but only if I bend the thousand.	JH	1	ショウ	ます		升 (ます)	JLPT_1 Jouyou_JH

The picture, appropriately, represents one <i>drop</i> of a <i>ten</i>&nbsp;(with a hook!).	* As a primitive, we shall use this to mean <i>glue</i> or <i>glued to</i>. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard NOT to remember it.

Think of a <b>Dr.</b> who is a <i>specialist</i> with a <i>needle</i> (an acupuncturist) and let the <i>drop</i> at the top represent the period at the end of <b>Dr.</b> In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.	* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the <i>needle</i> on the left and gets the meaning of an <i>acupuncturist</i>.	Ten specialties grants you the title of Dr. with a dot.	"Watch for doctor (#1694), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well ""learned"", with extensive knowledge.

After all, the <i>clam</i> and the <i>oyster</i> are incapable of walking <b>upright</b>.

For instance, the fact that things like the <i>mouth</i> of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a <i>woman</i> gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a <b>likeness</b> to the <i>opening</i> of the <i>woman</i> from whom you were born.		Women share a common likeness. Their mouths are always open, whining about this and that.	From a woman´s other 口comes a baby with a perfect likeness.

The kanji here is read, top to bottom: <i>mama</i> . . . <i>oyster</i>. All you need to do is imagine <b>piercing</b> an ear so that it can hold a mother-of-pearl (actually, a <i>mama</i>-of-pearl) you have just wrested from an <i>oyster</i>.		Ariel the Little Mermaid´s clamshell bra was held to her breasts by piercings.	The sad fate of Mama shellfish was to be captured and pierced to make an earring.

The <i>needle</i> on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the <i>teenager</i> growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the <i>needle</i> at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that ""We Shall <b>Overcome</b>"" the plague, will the <i>needle</i> cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character."

Eventide is just another word for evening, and it has the word tide in it which we associate with water.	Drops of water shower the beach as the evening tide approaches: eventide.

A ""chip off the old block"" is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a <i>little</i> bit of <i>flesh</i>."	* When used as a primitive, the sense of <i>resemblance</i> is replaced by that of <i>spark</i> or <i>candle</i>. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for <i>moon</i> also carries a secondary sense of <i>fire</i>, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)	Using DNA matching, a very little bit of flesh can be used to show the resemblence between family members.

Here we imagine pouring it over a <i>rock</i> and watching the <i>sparks</i> fly as it bores a hole through the rock.		That stone has sparks coming out of it!

Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a <i>game of cricket</i> in which a <i>needle</i> is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a <i>rock</i> for a ball. A <b>smash</b> hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a <b>smashing</b> pitch would do the same with the <i>needle</i> wicket.

If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can <b>plane</b> a hunk of wood into shape.

At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty <i>mouth</i>, waiting for the <b>utensils</b> to arrive so the feast can begin.		Imagine four hungry mouths all sitting around the table.

When we refer to a <i>woman</i> as <b>exquisite</b>, we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but <i>few</i> and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word <b>exquisite</b> carries this same sense of ""seeking out"" the rare from the ordinary."

I find it strange that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train.

Why certain land becomes <b>marshy</b> is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to <i>seduce</i> the <i>water</i> over to its side. But, like most inordinate <i>seductions</i>, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy <b>marsh</b>.

While the geological history of the larger bodies of <i>water</i> is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how <b>creeks</b> are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of <i>water</i> somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The <b>creek</b> is thus a lesson in <i>water-craft</i>, as this kanji would agree.		A CREEK is a small trail of water easily crafted with a stick.	Creeks are small water, easily crossed with a simple i-beam.	JH	1	コウ	え		江 (え)	JLPT_1 Jouyou_JH

On the left is the <i>water</i>&nbsp;- that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for <i>morning</i> learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word <b>tide</b>, just think of it in connection with the character for <i>eventide</i> that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the <i>morning</i>-<b>tide</b>, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own.		The morning tide is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.

In this kanji, it is under the <i>meadow</i>, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little <i>springs</i>."		The water that flows from the meadow is the source of life for the wild antelope.	The source of clean water is from the meadow (#134): it comes from that spring at the bottom of the cliff.

The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, <b>square jewel</b>, depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of <i>soil</i> on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays.	"* As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean <i>ivy</i>, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the <i>ground</i> to form a sort of ""second"" <i>ground</i> that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping."	Piling SOIL upon SOIL for aeons is how SQUARE JEWELS are formed deep in the earth.	How would you stop someone stealing your biggest square jewel? Bury it deep in the soil under ground.

Try to reverse Heisig´s story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies.

One <b><i>rin</i></b> is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something ""very, very tiny."" The kanji shows a <i>cliff</i> with a <i>computer</i> under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home <i>computer</i> that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one <b><i>rin</i></b>!"

The <i>littleness</i> is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted <i>mouth</i> of an <b>esteemed</b> ancestor. We may be used to <b>esteeming</b> the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also <b>esteem</b> the very <i>mouth</i> that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece.		An especially esteemed alien has three antennae on his helmet.	Remember that scene from Star Wars, where Luke is wearing that helmet that only his mouth could see, and was swinging at that little thing buzzing around the room?

"Simple mnemonic : ""The Japanese Judas-tree is the tree on which Judas hang himself to the ivy"" (Judas the traitor of the Christian bible).

Fixing <i>candles</i> to the branches of evergreen <i>trees</i>, it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs.

For the magic of the <i>wand</i> derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its <b>crude</b>, natural state.

First we see the primitive for <i>days</i>, an appropriate enough way to begin a <b>calendar</b>. Next we see a <i>grove of trees</i> growing under a <i>cliff</i>. The laws of nature being what they are, the <i>trees</i> would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the <i>days</i> on your wall <b>calendar</b>, you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that <i>grove of trees</i> each month, from January under the <i>cliff</i> to December on top of the <i>cliff</i>. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a <b>calendar</b> nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind.		Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a cliff to form or erode. A tree takes many months to grow. But days pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a CALENDAR.	This is just a picture of a wall calendar with a page for each month. The bottom half has the grid of days, the top half has a pretty picture of a forest this month. The cliff radical here is the top and left edges of the paper.

This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the <i>drop</i> hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has <i>not yet</i> fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, <b>vermilion</b> is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.)

Usually good <b>stocks</b> are referred to as ""blue chip,"" but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <i>vermilion</i>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves."		Which tree would you buy stocks in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one vermilion leaf left on the right?

The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing <b>imitation</b> <i>trees</i> in the <i>graveyard</i>. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long.		If I find out this furniture you´re selling me is made of imitation wood, I´ll put you in the graveyard.

Now we are back again to the essence of the true <i>graveyard</i>. The <i>water</i> may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate <b>vagueness</b> with the <i>graveyard</i> and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.		The precise locations of sailors who meet a WATERY GRAVE are vague.	The water in the graveyard has worn away the headstones, so the writing is vague.

Just think of the bodies as ""lying under boot-hill"" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat.

It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant <b>peach</b>, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named <b>Peach</b> Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also <i>portended</i> great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the <i>tree</i> that is associated with a <i>portent</i> of coming evil comes to be the <b>peach tree</b>.		The pits of a peach tree look like turtles.

Sauron´s One fiery eye stare at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.	You lost a staring contest with a turtle because you blinked your eye before he did. (The contest wasn´t fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don´t need to blink so often.) Eye comes first, because stare is most associated with eyes. And compare with challenge (#658) where this same obstreperous turtle challenges you to a finger wrestling contest.

The mouth of the king is displaying his bling.	What a pathetic display! The king is sprawled on his throne, head back and mouth wide open, fast asleep. We should never have let him drink so much at that banquet last night.	JH	1	テイ		進呈(しんてい): presentation		JLPT_1 Jouyou_JH
282	264	282	plug	栓	"<img src=""E6A093.png"" />"		plug, tree, wood, whole, umbrella, king, jewel, ball	10	12		Here we think of <b>plug</b> in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>ball</i>. Imagine a <i>tree</i> with a faucet in the side out of which tennis <i>balls</i> are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach <i>umbrella</i> into the <i>tree</i> to <b>plug</b> it up.		"The fat king under his umbrella offers useless advice to the workers. ""You´ll need the whole tree to plug that gap"". Imagine a grossly fat, incompetent king under a parasol giving annoying advice to sweating workers who know what they´re doing. (I always have trouble bringing up the ""whole"" primitive. This story reminds me how to build that part. )."	To plug the hole, you need to use a whole piece of wood - like a cork or something.

Of all the various forms <i>metal</i> can take, this one shows us <i>metal</i> <i>before</i> it has been refined. Imagine two photographs labeled ""<i>before</i>"" and ""after"" to show the process."		Pig iron is basic/crude metal, that is, before it has been processed.	Pig-iron is crude metal (金) before (先) it is refined.

This is the BOWL of an alchemist: see how he mixes metals in his bowl, as he follows the instructions from his book?	If I was begging with a BOWL, I would want GOLD and BOOKS.

The odd thing is that your <b>angling</b> rod is a <i>golden</i> <i>ladle</i> which you are using to scoop <i>gold</i>fish out of a river.		All the people that go to the Japanese festivals to catch fish part time are suckers. Me? I´m a pro. I bring a big-ass golden ladle. I´m a true ANGLING professional.	Imagine an effeminate Roman 2000 years ago angling with a golden ladle instead of a rod because it matches his eyes and hair better and it impresses the boys. (Why a Roman? Because ´angling´ is just the roman-derived way to say ´fishing´ - use this to distinguish fishing from angling.).

It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time.		A piece of metal with a name on it. Well, this is basically the definition of inscription.

It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subconscious reactions when the <i>truth</i> was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that <b>tranquillize</b> them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed.		Tranquilize - using a metal syringe to get the truth.	Enough gold can tranquilize the truth in anyone.	JH	1	チン	しず.める、しず.まる、おさえ		鎮まる (しず.まる), 鎮める (しず.める)	JLPT_1 Jouyou_JH

"The court jester wears a crown and is full of wind with bad jokes. He is superfluous to the King´s court.

Now add the glittering <i>chariot</i> that is emitting those <i>rays</i> and you have <b>radiance</b>.		Rays of light emitted from Apollo´s chariot = radiance. Don´t put the sun into this kanji.

In basketball however, tall children receive all the attention.	Tall children receive all the attention. They also make great receivers in football... this kanji also means ´catch´ (therefore a football receiver is a great image).

The exception are the <i>tall children</i> who are out on the school <i>grounds</i> practicing sports, and the <i>fat</i> ones who are out there burning off calories.

Imagine tall children sitting round the fire toasting marsh-mellows.	The cram school (309) tortures its students - especially the tall and fat ones who need to grow up - over a fire until they mellow.

If fish were cities, the whale would surely be the capital.	When the whale was first discovered it was the biggest fish people had ever seen.

The cottage is so small - it has an umbrella for the roof; soil for the floor and room for only one mouth.	My vacation cottage is nothing but a hole in the ground covered by an umbrella.	5	1	シャ、セキ	やど.る	校舎(こうしゃ): school building<br>田舎(いなか): the country, country side		JLPT_1 Jouyou_5

When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's <b>gentlemen</b>.	* The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the <i>samurai</i>, Japan's warrior class.	What a handsome gentleman. Standing up so straight, and broad shoulders too!! He´s like a modern samurai!	A gentleman has broad shoulders and doesn´t soil himself.	4	1	シ		学士(がくし): university graduate<br>修士(しゅうし): Masters degree program<br>紳士(しんし): gentleman<br>同士(どうし): fellow, companion, comrade<br>兵士(へいし): soldier<br>博士(はかせ): doctorate, PhD<br>武士(ぶし): warrior, samurai		JLPT_1 Jouyou_4

A villa is fancier (decorated with flowers) and more robust than the average.	The teenage mutant samurai turtles live in a villa with flowers on the roof so that the neighbours don´t get suspicious.

And so it is that we have <b>havens</b>.		A brush laying in dirty water is a haven for bacteria.	The haven for a BRUSH is in WATER.. Otherwise they get dry and withered and cant be used?!

351	329	351	breed	牧	"<img src=""E789A7.png"" />"		breed, cow, taskmaster	8	15		When it is time to <b>breed</b> new cattle, the bull is usually willing but the <i>cow</i> is often not. Thus the <i>taskmaster</i> to the right forces the <i>cow</i> into a compromising position, so to speak, so that she and her mate can <b>breed</b>.		"Imagine a taskmaster giving a cow the command to ""start breeding, and start doing it now!"", except that the cow takes his advice a bit too literally and starts chasing the taskmaster to carry out this command! instead of finding another cow to breed with. Hence, you see the taskmaster running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the cow."	Hint: This is the kanji from which taskmaster is derived. Actually, this kanji has nothing to do with breed, and a lot to do with pastures and shepherds (also for cowboys, japanese and spanish don´t differenciate between animals). Think of a cowboy (taskmaster) who brings his cows to the pasture.	4	1	ボク	まき	牧師(ぼくし): pastor, minister, clergyman<br>遊牧(ゆうぼく): nomadism<br>牧場(ぼくじょう): farm (livestock), pasture land, meadow, grazing land<br>牧畜(ぼくちく): stock-farming	牧 (まき)	JLPT_1 Jouyou_4
352	330	352	aggression	攻	"<img src=""E694BB.png"" />"		aggression, craft, taskmaster	7	15		The special <i>craft</i> of successful <i>taskmasters</i> is their ability to remain constantly on the <b>aggressive</b>, never allowing their underlings a moment to ponder a counter-<b>aggression</b> of their own.		Aggression is the craft of a good dominatrix.	AGGRESSION is a well-honed craft for any decent taskmaster.

It nearly always has its way.		An OLD TASKMASTER is no happenstance (coincidence). The older you get the more rigid in your ways.	Need to disambiguate from enemy (#443) as it´s easy to mix up antique and old here.

And later (Frame 1517) we will meet another association of criminals with <i>dogs</i>. The <b>prison</b> here depicts a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> (the long-timers and hardened criminals) into which the poor little c<i>hihuahua</i> (first offender) has been cast. The only thing he has to protect himself against the pack are his shrill and frightened <i>words</i>.		The wild dog family visits their cousin in prison.

"The mnemonic ""words to seduce the masses"" was just too vague and I kept forgetting it. So now instead I picture a seductive female reading aloud the imperial edict to the masses, thus ""seducing"" the masses."

Listening to the words in a recitation of Vogon poetry is worse than spending an eternity in hell. [Note: I assume those 2 reports are to warn against possible confusion with poem (#346) but how can you confuse Vogon poetry with an actual poem? Anyway, it´s the next frame, so it should be easy to keep them straight... Or maybe there´s a kanji for Vogon in RTK3?].

A PETA activist speaks at a meeting of butchers to rebuke them.

Burglars... those guys!!! Burglars only want money (clams) so that they can get needles (drugs) and party (fiesta)!

Imagine yourself inviting a few representative <i>trees</i> from the fields and orchards to join you around the table to give thanks.		The plantation is where we get our Christmas trees.

384	360	384	overgrown	茂	"<img src=""E88C82.png"" />"	pokuflowers	overgrown, flowers, parade	8	16		The sense of the key word <b>overgrown</b> is of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess - in this case a whole <i>parade</i> of weeds (outcast&nbsp;<i>flowers</i>). By way of exception, the <i>flowers</i> take their normal place over the enclosure.		The gay parade looks astonishing, as if overgrown with flowers.	When your garden gets OVERGROWN, it´s like the plants are mocking you. Here, you can see the roses actually parading around the yard, wilfully choking out the other, more docile plants.

The march of women - against intimidation in the workplace - is pretty intimidating in itself!	"Interesting that this kanji also has the meanings of ""dignity"" and ""threaten.""

In the case of this kanji, what is being constructed is not a skyscraper but a simple <i>float</i>.		Japanese festival floats are often so tall they need wood scaffolds to be completed.

A warrior stands guard at a bridge collecting shells as a levy for any who want to pass.	Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry.

It needs to be so <i>determined</i> by a <b>lock</b>smith. Now make a concrete image of that.		Even if you lock up your GOLD, a DETERMINED thief will get it in the end.	The best stories for this kanji tend to have a thief in them, which always makes me confuse them with the kanji for burglar (357).

As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the <b>nativity</b> we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history: it represents the <i>prolongation</i> of the eternal <i>Word</i> in time and space.		Nativity = born, being born. Think of birth as a painful and prolonged event. And of course, all the words and curses being yelled at the soon-to-be father for doing this to her!	When you are being born ( nativity ), your mother´s WORDS are PROLONGED. (Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis huuuuuuuuuuuuuurtss a lottttttttt~!!

Features like stones and groves of trees are the cornerstones of a happy zoo.	A zoo which is still under construction is already full of animals.

The virgin bridegroom tries to understand the new, mysterious part of his woman´s body - but with little success. It´s a zoo down there! (primitives placement: the part of the body is ´down there´ - the woman is ´left´ unsatisfied).	The only reason anyone talks about a bridegroom is if they´re about to or have just gotten married. Of course, then you have to go on your honeymoon. So you take your woman to the zoo for a month. Pretty cool honeymoon.	JH	1	セイ	むこ	婿(むこ): son-in-law	婿 (むこ)	JLPT_1 Jouyou_JH

In this frame, our eerie visitor brushes its robes against a nearby block of apartments and completely <b>demolishes</b> them, razing them to the <i>ground</i>.		If you stand too close to a DEMOLITION site, the dust might sting you like NEEDLES in your EYE and get your GARMENTs all dirty.	Since that needle eye thing turns up a lot, I turned it into Darth Vader. It kinda looks like him to me, with the eye being his metal mouth piece thing.

He thinks it´s cool. I think it´s pathetic.	"A poor, homeless child like Oliver Twist, with a hungry open mouth, is pathetic-- in the original sense of the noun ""pathos.""

The MONKEY likes to play hide and seek with the PACK of WILD DOGS by hiding in the LIDDED CROCK. But he is easy to see because the SCARF he always wears is at the base of the LIDDED CROCK.

Brocade is the art of sewing gold on a white towel.	Never heard of this word before encountering it here. So it turns out that the fanciest brocade in the world is actually a towel used by a Turkish monarch. It´s embroidered with gold and cocaine. Yes, cocaine - what you thought it´d be something else?

History of the first karate blackbelts: In those days, it was often difficult to find fresh, clean water, so samurai usually had to wash their sashes in stagnant puddles.

This is “Cape Strange” from FRAME 153, only with mountain in place of soil. Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives stone and strange.

To me, this looks like a pictograph of a road leading to the big city (see the buildings?) where there are plenty of places to be entertained. Unfortunately in this city, every store is the same: staples. What tools! [ayoung24].	Photographically, this kanji simply looks like a set of two speakers (the staples primitives) between the sub-woofer (primitive for same) -- all this as a tool to entertain a group of drunks at a club.	5	1	コウ、キョウ	おこ.る、おこ.す	興じる(きょうじる): to amuse oneself, to make merry<br>興業(こうぎょう): industrial enterprise<br>興奮(こうふん): excitement, stimulation, agitation, arousal<br>新興(しんこう): rising, developing, emergent<br>振興(しんこう): promotion, encouragement<br>復興(ふっこう): revival, renaissance, reconstruction<br>余興(よきょう): side show, entertainment<br>興味(きょうみ): interest	興行 (こうぎょう), 復興 (ふっこう), 振興 (しんこう), 興す (おこ.す), 興る (おこ.る)	JLPT_1 Jouyou_5

"* As a primitive, it means <i>whiskey bottle</i>. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle and the contents (about one-third full). You might also think of the Spanish ""porrón,"" a decanter shaped like a long-necked bird."	The sign of the bird on this whiskey bottle is of course the Famous Grouse blended Scotch.	"Normally birds fly south, but one bird flew west. People were worried about it and kept asking ""Is there any sign of the bird – you know, the one that flew west?""."

Males usually use either ""boku"" or ""ore"" (instead of ""watashi"") to refer themselves. ""Boku"" is slightly boyish and soft; ""ore"" is rough & tough.

The important thing here is to work with the elements <i>boat</i> and <i>dove</i> to make an image distinct from that of the former frame. Don't count on size alone to distinguish the <i>boat</i> from the <b>liner</b>.		The most famous LINER is the Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sunk. Just imagine that huge LINER strucking an even huger mass of white ice.

The silkworm (<i>insect</i>) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the <i>flowers</i>), digests them and transforms them into <i>thread</i> with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the <i>hood</i>). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception.		This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a cocoon. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar (insect). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the insect covered with thread, making a beautiful cocoon.	The magic flower is the reason why Spider-Man ended up miniaturized and confined inside a hood-like cocoon together with an insect. Now, only a walking stick separates them both.

It shows a fellow in a <i>top hat</i> and <i>scarf</i>, trying hard to look happy by putting a <i>walking stick</i> in his <i>mouth</i> sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.		If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven´t seen him after his decline. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him. Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical.	If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven´t seen him after his decline.

You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright.		The guy from pathetic (#401) shared his inmost feelings with a girl and she rammed a walking stick down his throat. It ruptured his inmost organs.	Besides making money from acting like a dog (see decline), the pathetic man has risked his inmost internal organs by becoming a cane swallower!

In the old west, animal skins were made into leather and their flesh was eaten, thus using the whole animal, which viewed from the animal side could be taken as humans asserting complete hegemony over them.

The <i>mouth</i> and <i>tool</i> are already familiar.		"Picture of a person facing you. 口 is the head. His right arm is raised (your left), to give you something from a tray 一. His legs ハ are below the tray. 呉れる、くれる, to give: 伯父がこの時計を呉れました, ""My uncle gave me this watch."" Following -て form of another verb, means ""to do the favor of"": 窓を開けて呉れませんか, ""Won't you open the window [do the favor of opening/kindly open the window]?"" Usu. written in hiragana."	I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a tool with a crank which plays music out of the bell mouth.

It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (<i>diced</i> into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated <b><i>tiger</i></b> promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless <i>human legs</i>). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.	* As a primitive element itself, the <i>human legs</i> are also swallowed up, but the meaning of <i>tiger</i> is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the <i>tiger</i> something else to eat.	Magic wand + first two strokes of pelt (皮) + diced + human legs. A wizard who turns people he doesn´t like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a tiger pelt - but things go awry when the tiger promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs. (a fitting end for a wicked wizard).	"Tigger, the tiger, (from Pooh stories) is happy to have found a magic wand.

Here we see the evil tyrannizing tiger. What is on his chest? A giant E, for EVIL, of course.

Among them we find pictures of <b>deer</b>, some of them showing men in <b>deer</b> masks. By <i>comparing</i> their drawings to real <b>deer</b>, Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt; and by <i>comparing</i> themselves to the <b>deer</b>, to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a ""double-<i>key</i>"" (the extra stroke through the element for <i>key</i>) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which <i>caves</i>, a double-<i>key</i>, and <i>comparing</i> gives us the kanji for <b>deer</b>."	* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the <i>tiger</i> was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: <i>painting of a deer</i>.	Bambi wanders into a cave and sees a side order of salad and 2 spoons...but what´s the main course?	Santa´s reindeer, Rudolf, opens a nightclub in a cave.
