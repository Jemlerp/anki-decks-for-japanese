Here we see a <i>strange house</i> - perhaps the haunted <i>House</i> of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread <i>House</i> that lured Hansel and Gretel to <b>draw near</b>.		"The strange house has a sign saying ""DRAW NEAR"" in its window, instead of a ´Beware´ sign. It must be a trick!"	Imagine a horror movie set in a haunted mansion. The house is very strange.

205	193	205	wealth	富	"<img src=""E5AF8C.png"" />"		wealth, house, wealth, one, ceiling, mouth, rice field, brains	12	9		Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for <b>wealth</b> is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the <b>wealth</b> is kept under the roof of the same <i>house</i>.		Remember Ducktales? That rich duck had that room in his house where he kept all the wealth! He had so much in that house you could even swim in it!	In ancient Japan, a RICE FIELD is a unit of wealth as it can produce enough to feed all the MOUTHs in ONE HOUSE.	5	3	フ、フウ	と.む、とみ	富(とみ): wealth, fortune<br>富む(とむ): to be rich, to become rich<br>富豪(ふごう): wealthy person, millionaire<br>豊富(ほうふ): abundance, wealth, plenty, bounty	富強 (ふきょう), 富裕 (ふゆう), 貧富 (ひんぷ), 富む (と.む), 富 (とみ)	JLPT_3 Jouyou_5
222	209	222	inter-	相	"<img src=""E79BB8.png"" />"		inter-, tree, wood, eye	9	10		The prefix <b>inter-</b> stirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>eye</i>. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own <i>eye</i> before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for <b>inter-</b>human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji!		The prime minister is having inter-course behind that tree! All you can see are his eyes poking out from the righthand-side of the tree.	"ソウ/ショウ/あ INTER /MUTUAL /ASPECT /PHASE /MINISTER. ""Long ago, before there were telephones, people living far from one another would climb trees to eye each other´s aspects and inter-act for their mutual benefit.

More concretely, it shows us a <i>tree</i> that is <b>not yet</b> fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the <i>tree</i> has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the <i>tree</i>.		I believe a better version of that by mameha1977: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree (木) does not yet (未) have exremities (末) of vermilion (朱).

230	217	230	extremity	末	"<img src=""E69CAB.png"" />"		extremity, tree, wood, one	5	10		This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the <b>extremity</b> of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.		The tree has reached the extremity of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.	There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let´s try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his extremity into a small hole in a tree.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the extremity? The longer one or the shorter one?

You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where <i>flowers</i> picked with the <i>right</i> hand grant eternal <b>youth</b>; and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens.		The young little girl held a cute flower in her right hand.	In Hawaii, if you wear a flower over your left ear, it means you are taken.

As the <b>grass</b> begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny <i>flowers</i> dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of <b>grass</b> somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in <i>flowers</i> once as a sort of <i>early</i> harbinger of spring.		Grass grows in earlier than flowers.	This grass is very long.

When a <i>flower</i> ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even <b>suffers</b>. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better.

The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the <b>leaf</b> that feeds the <i>flowers</i> on a <i>tree</i>. The element for <i>generation</i> interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a <i>tree</i> from one <i>generation</i> to the next is like its ""turning over a new <b>leaf</b>."""

The gravedigger makes his LIVELIHOOD digging in the graveyard all day For graveyard, imagine an idyllic picture: beautiful grass with the sun shining down...and a dog peeing on one of the graves.

Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the <b>status quo</b> with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love.		It was left to the turtle to make right with the dog and thus maintain the status quo..
